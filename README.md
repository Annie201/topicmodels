# Topic Models

This repository contains code to help you get up and running with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model in R.

The script `fit-topicmodel.R` fits a topic model to a set of documents. It reads in the documents from a CSV file, `documents.csv`, where each line is a document.

## R Packages

The script uses the R packages `tm` (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html) and `lda` (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lda/index.html).
