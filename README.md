# Topic Models

This repository contains code to help you get up and running with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model in R.

The script `fit-topicmodel.R` fits a topic model to a set of documents. It reads in the documents from a CSV file, `documents.csv`, where each line is a document.

## R Packages

The script uses the R packages `tm` for data preparation, `lda` for fitting the topic model, and `plyr` because it's awesome.
